        "\n",
        "So far, you have been working with very short lists of data or generating your own lists of data. However, in data-driven science, you'll likely have to work with large sets of data that can come in a variety of formats: comma-separated values, tab-separated values, space-separated values, to name a few. Sometimes specific quantities can come in strange formats depending on the meaning, for example, a list of times might be formatted in hours, minutes and seconds, like this: 10:03:20. Whatever format your data might come in, you must be able to read in that data and separate it into more easily processed components that you can then analyze. That's exactly what parsing data means.\n",
